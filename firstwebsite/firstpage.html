    <h1>My Favorite Sports Team</h1>
    <p>I used to attend the Florida State University from 2012-2014. Thus, my favorite football team is the <strong>FSU Seminoles.</strong> <br>
        Winning the <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2022/09/when-was-the-last-time-florida-state-won-a-national-championship-in-football">National Championship in 2013</a>
        was one of the most exciting years of my life. <br> Unfortunately, when Jameis Winston stole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAEszv5tYQE">crab legs</a>, 
        the team went downhill and has been recovering ever since.
